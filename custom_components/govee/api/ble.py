"""Direct BLE client for Govee BLE lights.

Implements the Govee BLE wire protocol for local control of Govee BLE-only
light devices (Govee_*, ihoment_*, GBK_* advertising name prefixes), bypassing
the cloud REST API. This is the foundation module for the hacs-govee BLE
direct-control feature.

Protocol reference
------------------
The wire protocol is validated against two independent sources:

* ``Beshelmek/govee_ble_lights`` — the de-facto reference HACS component with
  76 SKU profiles (GitHub 122 stars). This module matches Beshelmek's frame
  layout, XOR checksum algorithm, characteristic UUID, and command byte values
  exactly. Notably it sends brightness as ``0-255`` unchanged for all SKUs
  (including segmented models) and ends the segmented-color frame with the
  ``0xFF 0x7F`` tail — both differ from PR #52's original ``api/ble_direct.py``.

* The existing ``api/ble_packet.py`` module in this codebase, which already
  builds the same 20-byte framing + XOR checksum shape for cloud MQTT
  passthrough commands (Music Mode, DreamView, DIY scene). This module reuses
  ``build_packet()`` from there to avoid duplicating the packet primitive.

Characteristic UUIDs
--------------------
Both primary Govee BLE light variants (segmented and single-zone) use the same
vendor-specific characteristic for writes:

* Write: ``00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d2b11``
* Read (notifications): ``00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d2b10``

HA integration pattern
----------------------
``GoveeBLEDevice`` is structured as a self-contained device library so the HA
wiring code mirrors ``led_ble`` — the canonical HA core BLE light integration.
The class exposes the same API surface as ``led-ble``'s ``LEDBLE`` so that if
we later extract it to a ``govee-ble-lights`` PyPI package for an upstream HA
core contribution the refactor is mechanical.

See ``docs/_research/2026-04-08_ble-direct-support.md`` and
``docs/_research/2026-04-08_ha-ble-integration-patterns.md`` for full context.
